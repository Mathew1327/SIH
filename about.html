                <p class="poppins-text">Welcome to our Computerized Cognitive Retraining Program for Home Training of Children with Disabilities. Our project aims to provide a comprehensive and accessible platform for children with disabilities to engage in cognitive training activities from the comfort of their homes.</p>
                <p class="poppins-text">Our program offers personalized cognitive training plans tailored to the specific needs and abilities of each child. Through interactive gameplay, puzzle-solving elements, and a variety of question types, we aim to stimulate cognitive development and enhance critical thinking, problem-solving, and memory skills.</p>
                <p class="poppins-text">With features such as progress tracking, instant feedback, and customizable quizzes, our platform empowers children to take control of their cognitive growth journey. Additionally, we provide professional support and guidance to ensure that parents and caregivers are equipped with the resources and knowledge to support their child's learning effectively.</p>
                <p class="poppins-text">Join us in creating a supportive and engaging environment where children with disabilities can thrive and reach their full potential!</p>
